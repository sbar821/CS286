# CS286 Projects

- Project 1-
Covers basic work with MIPS assembly. We learned how to write if-then-else statements, while loops, and how working with floats requires different instructions. Split into three parts respectively. The first task has you calculate speed vs. speed limit and print the appropriate fine, if any. The second task has you read in numbers from the user, print a mathematical pattern based on input, and calculate the sum. The final task is a loan calculator where interest percentage, monthly payment, and principal are read in and you calculate how many months it would take for it to be paid off.
